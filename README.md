## Hey, I'm Shrinjay!

* **Computer Engineering, Class of 2025 @ uWaterloo**

* **Tech Lead, Computer Vision @ UWaterloo Aerial Robotics**

* **Formerly: Software Development Engineering Intern @Localintel**

I turn good dark roast and kombucha into meaningful, beautiful code. 

## What I work on: 

* :handshake: **Symbio, a CRM for non-profit partnership managers**. Non-profit leaders face tight budgets and often have to make do with basic tools, I know, as a former non-profit manager. Symbio offers action tracking, team management, communications management, built with Angular, Spring, ASP.NET, Eureka/Zuul and Pandas.
* :airplane: **Computer Vision System,  Waterloo Aerial Robotics**. I'm leading a team of 6, responsible for developing WARG's first computer vision driven enhanced autopilot to enable in-air and taxi decision making. I provide technical guidance and solution implementation, using Python with a Tensorflow YOLOv5 Model.
