# Heyo, I'm Shrinjay!

* **Software Development Engineering Intern @Localintel**

* **Tech Lead, Computer Vision @ UWaterloo Aerial Robotics**

I'm a little addicted to solving problems, big and small, you can catch me up at 1am trying to iron out a bug or impulsively signing up for my third back-to-back hackathon. I fuel this low-grade insanity with excessive coffee. I build software that scales into products which solves problems, for myself and for others. I'm fascinated by intelligent systems, and I'm working on building the ML infrastrcuture required to make a drone fly itself at WARG.

In short, I turn a good dark roast into meaningful code. 

# Stuff I work on: 

:handshake: **Symbio, a CRM for non-profit partnership managers**. Non-profit leaders face tight budgets and often have to make do with basic tools, I know from my time wtih mutliple Canadian youth-led non profits. Its time to empower our non-profit leaders with products made just for them. Symbio offers action tracking, team management, communications management, and analytics to help non-profit managers build more and better partnerships. I'm still working on this, looking to add complete GMail and GDrive integration alongside an ML engine to help discover new partnerships. I hope to turn this into a launched product in the next 4 months.
