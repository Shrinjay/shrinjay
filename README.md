# Heyo, I'm Shrinjay!

* **Computer Engineering, Class of 2025 @ uWaterloo**

* **Software Development Engineering Intern @Localintel**

* **Tech Lead, Computer Vision @ UWaterloo Aerial Robotics**

I'm a little addicted to solving problems, big and small, you can catch me up at 1am trying to iron out a bug or impulsively signing up for my third back-to-back hackathon. I fuel this low-grade insanity with excessive coffee. I build software that scales into products which solves problems, for myself and for others. I'm also fascinated by intelligent systems.

In short, I turn a good dark roast into meaningful code. 

# Stuff I work on: 

:handshake: **Symbio, a CRM for non-profit partnership managers**. Non-profit leaders face tight budgets and often have to make do with basic tools, I know from my time wtih mutliple Canadian youth-led non profits. Its time to empower our non-profit leaders with products made just for them. Symbio offers action tracking, team management, communications management, built with Angular, Spring, ASP.NET, Eureka/Zuul and Pandas. I'm still working on this, looking to add complete GMail and GDrive integration alongside an ML engine to help discover new partnerships. I hope to turn this into a launched product in the next 4 months.

:airplane: **Computer Vision System,  Waterloo Aerial Robotics**. I'm leading a team of 6, responsible for developing WARG's first computer vision driven enhanced autopilot to enable in-air and taxi decision making. I provide technical guidance and solution implementation, using Python with a Tensorflow YOLOv2 Model.

## Other Projects: 
* :moneybag: **EasySell**, A web-based point of sale for small business and non profits. Integrating transactions, logging, user authentication, inventory mangement and performance analytics using Express, React, MongoDB, and Passport-JWT. My first project, inspired by the hell of being a cashier.
* :loudspeaker: **Smart-Market**, automating the marketing workflow by generating marketing content using NLP, driven by a GPT-2 Model, and posting to Facebook. Won Best Business Solutions @ MacHacks 2021. 
* :frog: **PogChat**, enabling location-specific mass video and text chat, using GIS queries and dynamic Vonage video session generation and storage. Built @ HackTheNorth 2020++
* :stethoscope: **The PuMP Wesbite**, developed an in-house blog and opportunity management platform for PuMP using NodeJS, Express, MongoDB and Passport-JWT.
* :chart_with_upwards_trend: **Lazy-Buffet**, automated investment analysis for NYSE securities based on fundamental financial analysis, like Buffet, but lazier.
