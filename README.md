## Heyo, I'm Shrinjay!

***Computer Engineering @ uWaterloo**

***Software Development Engineering Intern @Localintel**

***Tech Lead, Computer Vision @ UWaterloo Aerial Robotics**

I'm a little addicted to solving problems, big and small, you can catch me up at 1am trying to iron out a bug or impulsively signing up for my third back-to-back hackathon. I fuel this low-grade insanity with excessive coffee. I build software that scales into products which solves problems, for myself and for others. I'm fascinated by intelligent systems, and I'm working on building the ML infrastrcuture required to make a drone fly itself at WARG.

In short, I turn a good dark roast into meaningful code. 

**Languages I know**: Java, C#, C++, Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS \
**Frameworks I use**: Spring, ASP.NET, ExpressJS, NodeJS, Flask, Angular, React, OpenCV, Tensorflow \
**Tools I can use**: MongoDB, CockroachDB, PostgreSQL, Postman, Git, Github, Atlassian Suite
