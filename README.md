I'm a little addicted to solving problems, big and small, you can catch me up at 1am trying to iron out a bug. I build software that scales into products which solves problems in my life, like a free point-of-sale developed when I worked as a Cashier, or a CRM for non-profits. I like to write meaningful code. 

**Languages I know**: Java, C#, C++, Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS \
**Frameworks I use**: Spring, ASP.NET, ExpressJS, NodeJS, Flask, Angular, React, OpenCV, Tensorflow \
**Tools I can use**: MongoDB, CockroachDB, PostgreSQL, Postman, Git, Github, Atlassian Suite
